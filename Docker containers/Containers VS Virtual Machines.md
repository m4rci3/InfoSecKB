Docker containers offer lightweight virtualization by sharing the host OS kernel, enabling faster startup and smaller storage footprint compared to virtual machines (VMs). While this means you can only run containers of the same OS as your host (e.g., Windows 11 containers on Windows 11), VMs virtualize the entire machine, allowing different OSs but with slower startup and larger storage needs. Installing Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) enables running Linux containers on Windows
