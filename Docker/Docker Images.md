A Docker image is a self-contained package that holds everything your application needs to run, including code, runtime, libraries and settings. These are built using [Dockerfiles](https://github.com/m4rci3/InfoSecKB/blob/main/Docker/Dockerfiles.md). A docker image is a platform-independent image that can be built into any environment and pushed to the docker hub or other platforms(such as Github) and then pulled by others with different OS environments where they can deploy theme images into full blown [Docker Containers](https://github.com/m4rci3/InfoSecKB/blob/main/Docker/Docker%20Containers.md).
