Docker allows to package the application with the environment configuration so that you may deploy or send somewhere it else . This is the docker image , it not only has the source but also complete environment configuration (e.g. JS app, node, npm, Linux) you can also add environment variables, such as creating files or directories.

Docker images can be found in Docker registries; a storage and distribution system, docker themselves hosts a number of these images [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-hub/), however other individuals or groups can publish them here or other places like Github as well.
