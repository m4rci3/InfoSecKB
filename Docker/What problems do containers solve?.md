Let’s say you’re developing an application, this would need multiple binaries and packages from different locations in order to build it / develop it, and say you had multiple developers, in order for this application to be developed across multiple machines you would need to have the same versions of these programs and binaries and the same exact configurations . This alone would have you run into a lot of issues, either with human error or because your developer team is using different operating systems. Docker containers allow the creation of the exact same configurations of the needed binaries , including version.
