### Most if not all explanations will be explained at a pretty high level**
Docker is an open-source platform designed to automate the deployment of applications within lightweight, portable containers. Containers encapsulate an application along with its dependencies, binaries, configuration files, and libraries, all isolated from the host OS via Dockerâ€™s container runtime. This abstraction allows for consistency across environments, eliminates conflicts caused by differing system configurations, and supports efficient resource utilization through OS-level virtualization. Docker offers networking capabilities through user-defined bridge, host, or overlay networks. Images, defined in Dockerfiles, serve as immutable blueprints for container instantiation and are managed via registries like Docker Hub. More detail in each of these topics are broken down further in their respective files within this repository.
