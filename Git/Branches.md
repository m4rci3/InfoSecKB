A **branch** is a separate path for your project’s development. It allows you to work on new features or fixes without affecting the main codebase. You can experiment and make changes safely before merging it back into the main code base. When starting out you will be in something called the main branch, for a group/team workflow we would want spread out over different branches ,so that we are not all working on the same line at the same time and for organizational reasons , however until you actually ‘_push’ these changes to GitHub website these are not visible to the public, however they are to those on your team.
