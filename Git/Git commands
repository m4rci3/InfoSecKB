Make a directory a Git repository 

```bash
git init . #turns the current working directory into a Git repository
```

Make specific files to be ignored 

```bash
vim {or nano} .gitignore
```

See what files have been modified, added or deleted since the last commit.

```bash
git status
```

Create , list, delete  branches: 

```bash
git branch
```

Switch to a different branch in the repository 

```bash
git checkout {branchname}
```

See the logs of any commits :

```bash
git log 
```

Show difference between the current state of your files and the last commit. Helps to see changes

```bash
git diff
```

Stage changes for commit. It tells Git to include your modified or new files in the next commit. Adding your changes to a list of updates you want to save permanently

```bash
git add {name of modified file} # for a specific file that you want to update 
git add .# makes changes to all of the files within the branch 
```

Unstage 

```bash
git restore --staged {file}
```

Commit the changes

```bash
git commit -m "here you should add a description of any of the changes you made , it is very good to be verbose on all of the changes you did and what they did" 
```

Finally push the changes made to the GitHub repository: 

```bash
git push
```
