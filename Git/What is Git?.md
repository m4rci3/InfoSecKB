### Git

*Git* is a version control system that tracks changes to a file , almost like a save point in a game. Each developer can work on their own version of the project or their own portion of it without interfering another developers work, usually any changes made will only affect in their ‘local repository’ then the developers can send their changes to the ***main*** or sometimes referred to as ***master*** remote repository. *Git* is the software that runs on the command line , this is not needed if all you want to do is use the GUI , although if you prefer to use the command line that is fine too. “Everything in Git is checksummed before it is stored and is then referred to by that checksum. This means it’s impossible to change the contents of any file or directory without Git knowing about it.”

### What is the difference between Git and the Github Desktop App?

The *GitHub desktop*  (https://desktop.github.com/download/) allows you to run most of the commands in *git* through a GUI. Most of the desktop application is self explanatory , you are able to see all of the changes that you made on your LOCAL repository, you can save these changes you made locally or ‘*commit*’ them to a ‘*branch’.* 

### The Github Website

*GitHub* is the website  to host the GitHub repository , you can do most of what you need to do here though, it would be better to work through either the CLI or the GUI application.  

### What are commits?

*Commits* are snapshots of the project files at a specific point in time. They record the changes made including adding, modifying or deleting files. Each commit has a unique identifier and a message explaining what was done 

### What are branches?

A *branch i*s like a separate path for your project’s development. It allows you to work on new features or fixes without affecting the main codebase. You can experiment and make changes safely before merging it back into the main code base. 
When starting out you will be in something called the main branch, for a group/team workflow we would want spread out over different branches ,so that we are not all working on the same line at the same time and for organizational reasons , however until you actually ‘*push’* these changes to GitHub website these are not visible to the public, however they are to those on your team. 

### What are pull requests?

‘*pull requests*’ are when *typically* working with a team and someone has made changes to a branch ,but before they can *push* those changes to main they need to be approved by the rest of the team before we see any actual changes
