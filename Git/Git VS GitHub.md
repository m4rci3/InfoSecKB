**Git** is a version control system that tracks changes to a file , almost like a save point in a game. Each developer can work on their own version of the project or their own portion of it without interfering another developers work. 

Usually any changes made will only affect in their ‘local repository’ (which is just what is saved to their local computer) then the developers can send their changes to the _**main**_ or sometimes referred to as _**master**_ (but this has been mostly deprecated due to the connotation of the language used when initially developing git) remote repository.

"Everything in Git is 'check-summed' before it is stored and is then referred to by that checksum. This means it’s impossible to change the contents of any file or directory without Git knowing about it.”

#### GitHub
GitHub is a service, it is a hosting service for **Git** repositories and is maintained by Microsoft.

#### What is the difference between Git and the Github Desktop App?
The [GitHub desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/) allows you to run most of the commands in **git** through a GUI while also pushing these changes to the Github hosting service.

Most of the desktop application is self explanatory, you are able to see all of the changes that you made on your _LOCAL_ repository, you can then save these changes you made locally or [[Commit]] them to a [[Branch]]
